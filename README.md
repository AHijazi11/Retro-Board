# Retro Board

This project is inspired by FunRetro. A retrospective board is used within the Scrum workflow. Scrum is the most popular Agile style of software project management used to guide the software development lifecycle. As a part of the Sprint Retrospective, team members will use a retrospective board to reflect on what went well and what they need to improve on for next time.
